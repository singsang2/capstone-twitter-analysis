    "## Business Case\n",
    "As of January of 2020, there are approximately 145 million users on Twitter. 22% of Americans are on Twitter and 500 million tweets are sent each day globally. This is why many companies internationally use Twitter for marketing. In fact 80% of Twitter users have mentioned a brand in a tweet, and 77% of Twitter users feel more positive when their tweets have been replied by the mentioned brand [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that Twitter is one of the platforms that provides people to share their opinion, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions about virtually anything including certain products freely, and for any companies, this is like a gold mine waiting to be mined for `opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers of our behaviors` [2].\n",
